        "a": "Too high; would require only 5Ω total resistance.",
        "b": "Incorrect; recheck total resistance.",
        "c": "Correct. Total resistance = 5Ω + 5Ω = 10Ω, I = V/R = 10/10 = 1 A.",
        "d": "Too low; underestimates current."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Parallel resistance = (5×5)/(5+5) = 2.5Ω. I = 10/2.5 = 4 A.",
        "b": "Too low; miscalculated total resistance.",
        "c": "Incorrect; check parallel formula.",
        "d": "Too low; this is for higher resistance."
