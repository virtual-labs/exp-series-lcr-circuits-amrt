      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Too high; would require only 5Ω total resistance.",
        "b": "Incorrect; recheck total resistance.",
        "c": "Correct. Total resistance = 5Ω + 5Ω = 10Ω, I = V/R = 10/10 = 1 A.",
        "d": "Too low; underestimates current."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Parallel resistance = (5×5)/(5+5) = 2.5Ω. I = 10/2.5 = 4 A.",
        "b": "Too low; miscalculated total resistance.",
        "c": "Incorrect; check parallel formula.",
        "d": "Too low; this is for higher resistance."

        "a": "Too high; overestimates current.",
        "b": "Correct. Parallel of 2Ω & 2Ω = 1Ω. Total = 2Ω + 1Ω = 3Ω. I = 6/3 = 2 A.",
        "c": "Too low; misapplied Ohm’s law.",

        "a": "Incorrect. Time period is the duration of one cycle, not the cycle itself.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Amplitude is the maximum value, not a full set.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Frequency is the number of cycles per second.",

        "a": "Incorrect. At resonance, power factor is maximum, not zero.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Value too low for resonance condition.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Resonant circuits have unity power factor.",
        "d": "Correct. At resonance, impedance is purely resistive → PF = 1."
