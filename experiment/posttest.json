      "question": "6V is applied to a 2 ohm resistor in series with two 2 ohm resistors connected in parallel. The current through the first resistor is",
      "answers": {
        "a": "3 A",
        "b": "2 A",
        "c": "1 A",
        "d": "0.5 A"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Too high; overestimates current.",
        "b": "Correct. Parallel of 2Ω & 2Ω = 1Ω. Total = 2Ω + 1Ω = 3Ω. I = 6/3 = 2 A.",
        "c": "Too low; misapplied Ohm’s law.",
        "d": "Too low; current is underestimated."

        "a": "Time period",

        "c": "Frequency",
        "d": "Cycle"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Time period is the duration of one cycle, not the cycle itself.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Amplitude is the maximum value, not a full set.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Frequency is the number of cycles per second.",
        "d": "Correct. One complete set is defined as a cycle."

        "d": "1"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. At resonance, power factor is maximum, not zero.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Value too low for resonance condition.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Resonant circuits have unity power factor.",
        "d": "Correct. At resonance, impedance is purely resistive → PF = 1."
