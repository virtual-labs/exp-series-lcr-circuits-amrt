  <li>
    A series LCR circuit with <strong>L = 4 H</strong>, <strong>C = 1 µF</strong> and <strong>R = 20 Ω</strong> is tuned to resonance by connecting it across a variable-frequency AC supply. Calculate the ratio of the voltage across the inductance to that across the resistance.
  </li>

  <li>
    A series resonant circuit has <strong>L = 1.01 H</strong>, <strong>C = 20 µF</strong> and <strong>R = 70 Ω</strong> to which an alternating emf of <strong>100 V</strong> is applied. At which frequency of the applied voltage will the circuit be in resonance?
  </li>

  <li>
    Suppose the circuit parameters in a series RLC circuit are: <strong>L = 2.0 µH</strong>, <strong>C = 20.0 nF</strong>, <strong>R = 200 Ω</strong> and the source voltage is <strong>240 V</strong>. Determine the resonant frequency of the circuit and the amplitude of the current at resonance.
  </li>

  <li>
    Design an RLC band-pass filter with a centre frequency of <strong>25 kHz</strong> using a <strong>20 mH</strong> inductor whose resistance is <strong>75 Ω</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Design and simulate a series RLC circuit by choosing <strong>C = 4 nF</strong>, <strong>L = 10 mH</strong> and <strong>R = 75 Ω</strong>. Find the frequency of the circuit at which the impedance is minimum.
