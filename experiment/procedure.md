<h2>Components:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Resistor:</strong> A resistor is a passive electronic component having two terminals. It produces a voltage across its terminal which is proportional to the electric current passing through it in accordance with Ohm's law.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Lamp:</strong> A lamp is a replaceable component such as an incandescent light bulb. It is designed to produce light from electricity. These components usually have a base of ceramic, metal, glass or plastic, which makes an electrical connection in the socket of a light fixture.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Wire:</strong> A wire is a single, usually cylindrical, elongated string of metal. Wires are used to bear mechanical loads and to carry electricity and telecommunication signals. Wire is commonly formed by drawing the metal through a hole in a die or draw plate.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Switch:</strong> A switch is an electrical component. It can break an electrical circuit by interrupting the current or diverting it from one conductor to another.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Battery:</strong> A battery or voltaic cell is a combination of many electrochemical galvanic cells of identical type. Battery stores chemical energy. It can deliver higher voltage or higher current compared to single cells.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Voltmeter:</strong> A voltmeter measures the electrical potential difference between two points in an electric circuit. Analog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale in proportion to the voltage of the circuit; digital voltmeters give a numerical display of voltage by making use of an analog to digital converter.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ammeter:</strong> An ammeter is a measuring instrument. It measures the electric current in a circuit. Electric current is measured in amperes (A), hence the name.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Non-contact ammeter:</strong> It is a type of ammeter that need not be a part of the circuit.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Select the components from the right side of the simulator and connect them as in Figure 1.</li>
  <li>Black color appears at the end of the wires when the connection is complete.</li>
  <li>Choose values for resistor, capacitor, inductor, and battery.</li>
  <li>Find out the resonance frequency using the appropriate equation.</li>
  <li>Vary the frequency of the A.C. power source below and above the resonant frequency of the circuit, and measure the current at each frequency using a non-contact ammeter.</li>
  <li>Plot a graph by taking frequency along the X-axis and current along the Y-axis.</li>
</ol>
